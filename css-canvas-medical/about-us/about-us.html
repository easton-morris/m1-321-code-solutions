              Our mission is to give clinicians and they teams highly usable,
              intelligent tools to advance their practice of medicine &mdash; and
              improve their day-to-day.

          <p class="grey-text">
            Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records
            have fallen dramatically short of their promise to improve
            the quality and efficiency of health care. Clinicians spend far too
            long at their computers. Workflows are overly restrictive. Valuable
            medical data is left unstructured.
          </p>
          <p class="grey-text">
            We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their
            technology partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes
            art and science &mdash; technology can help or hinder this craft.
            Working with clinicians across the country, we think we
            have begun to build something that helps.
